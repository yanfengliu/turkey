# **turkey**: an Amazon Mechanical Turk turn-key segment tool.

**turkey** lets you easily create a web UI on Amazon Mechanical Turk to crowd-source image annotation data. Its main functions include:
* Customize the annotation modes and class labels on per-image basis
* Import previous annotations generated by either another human or an algorithm
* Zoom-in, zoom-out, delete, undo, reset

I'm aware that Amazon has recently released their own image segmentation tool. The advantage is that their tool is encapsulated into their internal API, which we have no direct access to. That means if you want to change something or add something that was not included in the official example, you would have to write a new tool from scratch. **turkey** is written in plain JavaScript, with a little help from jQuery and bootstrap. Feel free to adapt it to your needs.

Please note that **turkey only works on Chrome**. Development is still in progress. Ideas and suggestions are welcome!

## Configuring Amazon Turk to use turkey

Copy the contents of `Mturk.html` into the source code section when you create a custom HIT in the Amazon Turk Requester. After the HIT is created, simply **Publish Batch** with a CSV file of both image URIs and annotation modes that you provide. A sample CSV file may look like:

```
img_url,annotation_mode,classes,annotations
https://i.imgur.com/kcCSGTR.jpg, dot-polygon-bbox-link, person-dog-house,"[{'class':'house';'mode':'polygon';'data':[[85;450];[41;524];[96;581];[163;531]]};{'class':'dog';'mode':'polygon';'data':[[246;461];[203;489];[268;500]]}]"
https://i.imgur.com/2yOma1u.jpg, polygon, cat-person-sky-food,"[{'class':'cat';'mode':'polygon';'data':[[543,498];[534,524];[533;563];[542;578];[555;572];[559;559]]}]"
```

Here, we allow the worker to use **Polygon**, **BoundingBox**, **Link** and **Dot** modes for annotating the first image, but only the **Polygon** mode for the second. The class labels that the user can choose from are **house**, **person**, **car**, and **dog**. The first item in the list will be the default option. You can also import previous annotations by putting the correctly formatted json string into column "annotations".

Please note that the `annotations` column is meant to be JSON string, but to get around CSV formatting, we use `;` instead of `,` and single quote instead of double quote.

## Testing without Turk
You can test the code before deploying it on MTurk by opening `localDemo.html` in your browser. This file is a lightweight wrapper that will load `MTurk.html` off GitHub, passing a sample image to it in the process. If you don't see anything here, make sure to start Chrome with the `--allow-file-access-from-files` flag (or the equivalent configuration for the browser of your choice). This will allow this wrapper page to load MTurk.html.

## Unpacking data from .csv file
After the users annotate the images, Amazon Mechanical Turk provides a `.csv` file ready for downloading. `reviewAnnotations.m` contains a sample MATLAB UI that displays the downloaded annotations for review. The approval results will be written into a csv file to be uploaded to MTurk for batch processing. The MATLAB UI is shown below:
