# AGENTS.md — turkey

## What this is

An Amazon Mechanical Turk turn-key image-annotation tool in plain JavaScript (with jQuery and Bootstrap): per-image configurable polygon, bounding-box, dot, and link annotation modes, with import of prior human- or algorithm-generated annotations.
`src/MTurk.html` is what gets pasted into a HIT; `src/localDemo.html` exercises it without Turk; `example/reviewAnnotations.m` is a MATLAB UI for reviewing downloaded results.

## Fleet constitution

- Work headlessly by default. If only a browser or GUI can finish or verify the task, say why.
- Concurrent sessions share one worktree and one index: commit by explicit pathspec (`git commit -- <files>`), never `git commit -a`, `git add -A`, or `git add .`. (voxel c024b33.)
- Commit each verified unit of change to `main` without being asked, and push. Gates pass before any commit that touches code; a dependency change re-runs the audit gate.
- Toolchain baseline is Node 24. A repo that must keep an older major says so in its Gates section and keeps a CI job proving it.
- Runtime model calls are authorized and already paid for — this fleet has one user, with Claude Code and Codex subscriptions — so a program here may call a model at runtime, vision included.
- The top reasoning tier is rationed: spend it only on the hardest problem, or on directing the workhorse tier that does the work — and only at maximum effort or orchestration.
- High-risk work — persistence/migrations, security/auth, concurrency, money, supply chain, edits that reach sibling repos — escalates to the multi-cli-review skill.
- Error messages are a product surface: audit them as a class, including paths the task did not touch.
- Task-run evidence lives only under ignored paths and is deleted once nothing active needs it; it enters Git only when review promotes it into a repository input — a fixture, golden, snapshot, or contract. Tracked docs keep conclusions and provenance only.
- Git blob ceilings: a new or changed blob over 256 KiB needs an explicit repository-input reason; over 512 KiB binary, or 1 MiB anything, never enters ordinary Git. An external asset store or LFS requires explicit user approval.
- Steering compounds: a direction that outlives the immediate task lands that same session — `../fleet/FLEET.md` if fleet-wide, else this repo's `docs/policies/local-rules.md` — and you say where it went.
- Write prose one line per paragraph (no hard wrapping).
- Reviewer model pins live only in `../fleet/docs/skills/multi-cli-review.md`; a model a product itself calls is pinned in the repo that calls it. Never hardcode a model ID anywhere else.

## Gates

`npm test` (Vitest unit tests in `test/`) · `npm run test:e2e` (Playwright, Chromium) — both before every code commit. CI (`.github/workflows/test.yml`) runs the same pair; note this repo's default branch is `master`, not `main`.
